# openela.org website

The openela.org website is managed using `Hugo`. You can install it using your favorite package manager.

## Setup

Ensure you have the "Extended" version of Hugo, which includes features required by this repository.

### Linux

Hugo is available in many package managers (but not EPEL, yet). Downloading the latest release binary from github is an easy option.

### Mac

`brew install go`  
`brew install hugo`  
`brew install sass/sass/sass`  

## Building locally

To build the static site to the `public/` folder (i.e., for release) run `hugo`.

To run hugo in server mode and view the site in real time on your computer as you make updates, run `hugo server`

By default this will run the service locally on http://localhost:1313/ 

## Adding Content

To add new content to the site, decide what type of content it is (announcement, blog, news), and run

```
hugo new content content/<type>/Post-Title-Separated-By-Dashes.md
```

For example, to create a new Blog post titled "My First Blog" with the url /blog/my-first-blog, you'd run

```
hugo new content content/blog/my-first-blog.md
```

Then, open the file and edit as required. Make sure to set the post to *not* be a draft before publishing it.
