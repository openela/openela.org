The OpenELA Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is responsible for governing the technical aspects of the OpenELA community. We are dedicated to fostering a robust and open ecosystem for Enterprise Linux. We are focusing on a few key goals for 2025 that provide some exciting direction to defining and building the ecosystem needed across the Enterprise Linux community. Here's a glimpse into some of the goals for this year:

### Building a Common Foundation

The TSC is focused on providing a common foundation across Enterprise Linux distributions. This foundation allows distributions to maintain interoperability with other members of the OpenELA and provides vendors the assurance of compatibility between the distributions. The TSC is focused on providing simplicity and transparency in building this foundation.

### Enhancing Transparency and Participation

OpenELA is committed to greater transparency and inclusivity. The TSC meetings are shifting to an open model where OpenELA members will be invited to attend, providing valuable insights into the decision-making process. The TSC, when needed, may additionally establish a public office hour for community members to engage and collaborate directly. The TSC has started the process by transitioning to a Google Workspace for documents and meeting notes to allow for broader visibility.

### Expanding Contributions and Resources

OpenELA recognizes the importance of community contributions. The "[openela-contrib](https://github.com/openela-contrib)" GitHub organization will be a focal point for soliciting contributions. The existing OpenELA GitHub organization is dedicated to active development projects managed and supported by OpenELA members. Establishing the new organization allows the focus to be on projects that are intended for joint collaboration and may not be bug-for-bug compatible.

### Advancing Leapp and Release Processes

The TSC is also committed to making the [Leapp](https://openela.org/news/2025/04/leapp-provides-in-place-upgrades-openela-compatible-systems/) repository public on [leapp-repository](https://github.com/openela/leapp-repository) and adding further features to it. Leapp is a tool that is designed to improve system upgrades and migrations. Furthermore, the TSC will continue to refine the automated processes that ensure new Enterprise Linux sources are available promptly.

### Looking Ahead

The OpenELA TSC's goals reflect a strong commitment to collaboration, transparency, and technical advancement. By focusing on technical initiatives, expanding community engagement, and improving core tools, OpenELA is poised to play an even more significant role in the Enterprise Linux landscape. Stay tuned for more updates as these initiatives unfold!
