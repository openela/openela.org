In the final blog and video of this 3-part introduction to OpenELA, we have
Alan Clark, member of the office of the CTO at SUSE. Alan details the early
foundation that was laid when OpenELA began in 2023 and goes on to talk about
the planned projects for 2024 and beyond. A summary of the discussion is
offered below the video.

OpenELA’s primary focus in 2024 and beyond is to ensure the long term future of
this open, compatible enterprise standard. Several things have been done and
are in the process of being done to secure OpenELA’s foothold. Visit the
OpenELA [Git repo](https://github.com/orgs/openela-main/repositories) and get
involved by going to [www.OpenELA.org](http://www.openela.org). If Slack is not
a platform you can use, simply send an email to
[info@openela.org](mailto:info@openela.org) and a solution will be found to
allow you to participate in the collaboration.
