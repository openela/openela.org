OpenELA is a non-profit resource for independent software vendors (ISVs), independent hardware vendors (IHVs), processor manufacturers, cloud service providers (CSPs), telecommunications providers, government and public sector organizations, and other organizations that need rapid, reliable, secure, and free access to enterprise Linux sources to create downstream builds.  

RHEL 9.5 was released by Red Hat on November 13, and compatible sources were made available through OpenELA the following day, illustrating the speed and efficacy of the [directed automation processes](https://openela.org/news/2024/07/automated-process-linux-sources/) that OpenELA [announced](https://openela.org/news/2024/07/automated-process-linux-sources/) in July.
