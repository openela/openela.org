## User Documentation Repository Now Available

OpenELA is pleased to announce the creation of a [user documentation repository](https://github.com/openela/openela-documentation). From this starting point, contributors are now able to add documentation as they work through the source code repositories and make relevant notes.

Oracle has contributed a portion of Oracle Linux 8 and 9 documentation to serve as the foundation for the OpenELA documentation repository. This provides a starting point for subjects and includes areas such as Managing Core System Configuration, Setting up System Users and Authentication, and Setting up Networking.


## Contributing

The repository is set up in Markdown, a popular and easy-to-use text editor that should allow a wide range of contributors to submit content and other pull requests.

All documentation in this repository, both current content and future submissions, is subject to the [Creative Commons Attribution–Share Alike 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license.
