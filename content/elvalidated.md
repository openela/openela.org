Powered by the OpenELA community, ELValidated is the cross-distro framework that proves your apps work—everywhere Enterprise Linux runs.  
[**Validate Your Software Today**](https://github.com/openela/Compatibility)

## What Is ELValidated?

ELValidated is an open source verification and interoperability suite for Enterprise Linux operating systems developed by OpenELA. It is a toolkit and framework that allows you to validate the binary interface of libraries in a given operating system, and compare against published ABIs to verify that your application is compatible with the Enterprise Linux standard.

Powered by open source library `libabigail`, ELValidated helps ensure that applications and libraries built on one system compatible with OpenELA Compatibility Standard will run on another compatible system.

For independent software and hardware vendors (ISVs and IHVs), individual developers, contributors, and the end users that rely on their deliverables, it means confidence that applications will run as expected. And for the entire EL ecosystem, it means trust.

## Why ELValidated?

Open source, built by the community, and for the community, ELValidated means that that the community can:

* Save time and resources – Skip unneeded rebuilds, modifications and retests for multiple distributions.
* Ship with confidence – Spot compatibility issues early, before they derail release cycles.
* Increase scope of support * ELValidated allows you to expand coverage of supported distributions without increasing development effort.
* Empower user choice – Support all major OpenELA-compatible distros with a single validated build.
* Build trust – A shared ABI standard proves your claims with hard verifiable data.

ELValidated was developed by the OpenELA community for everyone, is free to use, and its usage is not limited to OpenELA compatible Linux distros.

## How It Works

Organizations can quickly and easily begin leveraging the benefits of ELValidated in three easy steps:

1. Compare – Scan against ELValidated’s trusted ABI reference.
2. Analyze – Detect binary-level ABI differences.
3. Validate – Get clear reports that immediately highlight possible risks or no risks at all.

ELValidated is ready to use in production, with features that deliver reliable scaling with simplicity of deployment and ops.

## Validated Distributions

ELValidated sets a common baseline for application compatibility across Enterprise Linux distributions. These distros are already validated:

* Oracle Linux
* Rocky Linux
* SUSE Linux Enterprise

... and more are on the way.

## For ISVs: Validate Once, Run Everywhere

**Expand your reach**  
Ship one build that works across Rocky Linux, SUSE Multi-Linux, Oracle Linux, and others.

**Accelerate Release Cycles**  
Validate on new OS versions early—no waiting on full vendor QA loops.

**Reduce support costs**  
Reduce distro-specific bugs and support tickets.

**Win more deals and keep end users happy**  
Prove compatibility with real data—great for RFPs, partner programs, and SLAs.

**Improve security**  
Shipping same application compatible with all of your target distributions, minimizes risk of unexpected security issues.
